# ----------------------------------------------------
# Configuration for the Face Sorting Project
# ----------------------------------------------------

# --- 1. Directory Paths ---
# Locations for all input and output files and folders.
directory_paths:
  source: "source_images"
  output: "output_sorted"
  log_file: "run_log.txt"
  ground_truth: "ground_truth.json"

# --- 2. Model Parameters ---
# Settings that control the behavior of the machine learning models.
model_parameters:
  # Face detection model.
  # Options: "hog" (fast, less accurate) or "cnn" (slow, very accurate).
  detector: "hog"

  # DBSCAN clustering settings.
  clustering:
    # Epsilon: Max distance between faces to be in the same group.
    # Good values are typically between 0.4 and 0.6.
    eps: 0.45
    # Min Samples: The minimum number of similar faces required to form a person's group.
    # A value of 2 is a good starting point.
    min_samples: 2

# --- 3. Processing Settings ---
# Parameters that affect how images are handled before analysis.
processing_settings:
  # Images wider than this value (in pixels) will be resized before processing
  # to speed up detection. Set to a very high number (e.g., 9999) to disable.
  resize_width: 1000

# --- 4. Output Settings ---
# Controls the naming of the output folders.
output_settings:
  # The prefix for the sorted person folders (e.g., Person_1, Person_2).
  folder_prefix: "Person_"
  # The name for the folder containing faces that don't belong to any cluster.
  unknowns_folder: "Unknowns"
